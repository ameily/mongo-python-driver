"""Tools to monitor driver events.

Use :func:`subscribe` to register subscribers for specific events. Only
events of type :data:`COMMAND` are currently supported. Subscribers must be
a subclass of :class:`Subscriber` and implement :meth:`~Subscriber.started`,
:meth:`~Subscriber.succeeded`, and :meth:`~Subscriber.failed`.

For example, a simple logging subscriber might be implemented like this::

    import logging

    from pymongo import monitoring

    class LoggingSubscriber(monitoring.Subscriber):

        def started(self, event):
            logging.info("Command {0.command_name} with request id "
                         "{0.request_id} started on server "
                         "{0.connection_id}".format(event))

        def succeeded(self, event):
            logging.info("Command {0.command_name} with request id "
                         "{0.request_id} on server {0.connection_id} "
                         "succeeded in {0.duration_micros} "
                         "microseconds".format(event))

        def failed(self, event):
            logging.info("Command {0.command_name} with request id "
                         "{0.request_id} on server {0.connection_id} "
                         "failed in {0.duration_micros} "
                         "microseconds".format(event))

    monitoring.subscribe(LoggingSubscriber(), monitoring.COMMAND)
